	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	<p> Hello. My name is MaÃ«l Quentin. I was born in Marseille, France, on January 17, 2002. I have lived in four countries: France, Pakistan, Nigeria, and the United States. The many locations that I have travelled to have given me a lot of knowledge on different cultures, and I am grateful for the many experiences that I have acquired through my life. I am currently a high school freshman at Stuyvesant High School, and I am always looking into ways better myself and the world around me.</p>
