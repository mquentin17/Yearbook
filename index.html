	<h1>MAEL QUENTIN</h1>
	<p> Hello. My name is MaÃ«l Quentin. I was born in Marseille, France, on January 17, 2002. I have lived in four countries: France, Pakistan, Nigeria, and the United States. The many locations that I have travelled to has given me a lot of knowledge on different cultures, and I am grateful for the many experiences that I have acquired through my life. I am currently a high school freshman at Stuyvesant High School, and I am always looking into ways better myself and the world around me.</p>

	<h2>MY HOBBIES </h2>
	<p> I enjoy playing video games, mostly because it is a way to distract myself from my usually stressful life, but also because it helps me enhance my French language skills by always playing with French people. I also enjoy sports, particularly basketball and swimming. I play basketball at the park right next to my house, and I have swimming class every other day at school.
